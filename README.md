# Laravel Examples:




```

A real coding assessment that shows what I can produce in 1 hour and 12 minutes. 

```
> [See Code](https://github.com/mokeseven7/laravel-power-hour)

 
```

Another coding assessment, but one with enough time code a little more elegantly.   
Examples include single line controllers, and a multi tenant isolation strategy without using query scopes. 


```

```

Rewriting as much of a company's REST API as a GraqhQL API in an hour.  
All I was given was a swagger file.

```
> [See Code](https://github.com/mokeseven7/huntress)




```

That time a company asked me to make an entire subscription service as the coding assessment. 

The code itself is not particularly impressive, but writing a feature complete billing service in 4 hours maybe is? 

(With bonus video of me awkwardly making my Youtube debut per their request)
